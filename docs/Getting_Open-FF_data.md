# Getting Open-FF data

> **Important: Open-FF data is based on FracFocus data. FracFocus has outlined their “Terms of Use” on [their download page](https://fracfocus.org/data-download). Those requirements are relatively generous, but users of Open-FF data should be familiar with them.**

See [this page](https://open-ff.org/what-we-do/getting-open-ff-data/) for up-to-date information
