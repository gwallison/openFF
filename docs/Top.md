- [Open-FF Overview](Open-FF_overview.md)
### Creating a new Open-FF data set
Currently this is performed about monthly under [FracTracker](https://www.fractracker.org/)'s sponsorship.  While most users of Open-FF's resources will have no need to create a data set from scratch, we present documentation below for transparency. 
- [Resolving chemical identity](Resolving_chemical_identity.md)
- [Calculating mass](Calculating_mass.md)
- [Standardizing text fields](Standardizing_text_fields.md)
- [Generating the Open-FF data set](Generating_the_Open-FF_data_set)
- [The Open-FF data repo](The_Open-FF_data_repo.md)
- [Getting Open-FF data](Getting_Open-FF_data.md)

### The Data Browser
Like the Open-FF data set, the  Data Browser is also updated regularly and users will likely have no need to generate them independently.  Nevertheless, the process is also documented below.

- [Generating the Browser](Generating_the_Browser.md)

### Interactive Notebooks - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
These notebooks are code Jupyter notebooks, but are designed to be used by people with no coding experience.  There are used to do targeted, well defined tasks that need user input.
