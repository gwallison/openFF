# Notebook Overview

Open-FF offers three forms of access to the Open-FF data: 
- Data download (either full data set or filtered)
- Data Browser
- Notebook analysis

The first two are on different ends of the spectrum: the first requires grappling with the details of a large data set to perform custom analysis whereas the second entails browsing through pre-compiled analysis with little ability to customize.

The third option is a hybrid of the first two that is intended to be used by folks who are NOT necessarily code-savvy, but still want to get to more detailed results than are possible with the Browser.

A simple example of this type of analysis is a pre-written notebook in which the user specifies a particular location and a distance from that location to find all fracking operations (reported in FracFocus) near that target location.  From there the notebook would calculate summaries such as when and where fracking occured, the companies involved, the chemicals used and their masses, and the number of proprietary claims and their masses.  This list would also include the hazard information compiled by the EPA and other details. 

In this example, the user needs only to know the target location and to follow the instructions in the notebook.  The pre-written code in the notebook takes care of the downloading, the data processing, etc.  
We are just staring to build these notebooks but are excited about the possibilites they can give to anyone wanting to know more about fracking chemicals.

These notebooks are modeled after the work of the [Environmental Enforcement Watch](https://www.environmentalenforcementwatch.org/) of EDGI.  Their notebooks allowed non-programmers do sophisticated analysis report generation from complicated EPA data sets.
