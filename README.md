# Summary
The [FracFocus.org website](https://fracfocus.org/) serves as the “national hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosure registry” for the fracking industry. It contains over 200,000 disclosures of fracking events, encompassing approximately 6 million individual chemical records.  

However, FracFocus is underutilized as a research resource because it is full of errors, contains multiple formats, and many important features are obscured or are not standardized(). It is a major undertaking to prepare the FracFocus data for all but trivial research questions.  The Open-FF project aims to remedy these issues to provide an independent, free and reliable source of the industry’s own chemical reporting. At its core, Open-FF simply takes the FracFocus data and pairs it with corrections, clarifications, calculations, and alerts that add perspective to the industry’s published data.  This core data set is then packaged in a number of ways to make it available online to everyone from the hard-core data analyst to the non-technical casual browser.  The project uses a combination of automated methods and manual curation to remove much of the ambiguity of both chemical identification and quantity in the FracFocus data. Open-FF’s development between 2019 and 2023 is documented at CodeOcean () and is currently being developed at GitHub. Publications using the Open-FF data include an analysis of chemicals regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, from which the industry has been exempted () and examinations of PFAS use and trade secret claims().  Up-to-date data sets and an online data browser are maintained through the sponsorship of the FracTracker Alliance.
