# External data in Open-FF

One of the primary aims of the Open-FF project is to provide perspective to the FracFocus data. One way in which that is accomplished is to connect tha FracFocus data with external data sets.  Those connections are compiled during the data set generation process either with freshly downloaded data or with data sets that have been previously identified. Here are some examples:

- From EPA's CompTox lists:
    - Clean Water Act lists
    - Safe Drinking Water list
    - the TSCA "UVCB" chemcical list
    - IRIS list
    - PFAS master list
- EPA's ChemInformatics Hazard classifications
- California's Prop. 65 list
- The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX) list
- EPA's 'diesel' list of chemicals 

- State-held latitude/longitude values for wells 
- USGS PADUS geographical database
