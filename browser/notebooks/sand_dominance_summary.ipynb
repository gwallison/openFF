    "In July 2024, **[Open-FF found](https://open-ff.org/2024/07/30/fracking-sand-dominated-disclosures-patterns-and-problems/)** over 2,000 disclosures that were apparently misreporting the percentages of water and sand. In our process of trying to contact the operators that published those disclosures, FracFocus Support informed us that FracFocus was preparing to alert the companies to the sand-dominance issue so that they might correct errors.\n",

(This excludes disclosures with either carbon dioxide or nitrogen gases, as they are reported to allow high percentages of sand.)  This running list of disclosures was started on Aug 4, 2024 and is updated most days. If a disclosure is found to have that >50% sand condition, it is added to the list and the `date_added` column indicates when.  If that disclosure is corrected, that is the >50% sand condition is no longer present, the `date_removed` column indicates the day that occurred. \n"
