# How to use Notebooks

"Notebooks" are files that are combination of code and text that can guide the user throug execution.  Open-FF's notebooks are 'jupyter' notebooks and the programming language used is Python.  However, the user does not need to know any of this.  

To execute a notebook, a user opens it at an online service called Google Colaboratory ("colab"). Through the interaction of the notebook and the colab environment, the user has access to a very powerful analysis system with generous online storage and computing power.    The free version of this service has been completely adaquate to execute the notebooks we've written.  The storage only lasts for the duration of the session, so once your work is completed, you will want to download it to your machine.
