    "> ## Executive summary\n",
    "> Although individual FracFocus disclosures may give the impression of a highly detailed and complete record of the chemicals injected into fracked wells, in reality, disclosures are far from transparent.  Members of the public looking to understand potential health and envirnomental consequences of frackings must come to grips with masked reports and  omissions from a full reporting.  These include proprietary claims and ambiguous data as well as missing chemicals because of reporting based on abbreviated lists. All of these sources of absent disclosure likely hide important dangerous materials. Although FracFocus is an important window into the industry's use of fracking chemicals, we must remember that it is far from a complete view.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/) is one of the biggest publicly available data sources of fracking chemical uses in the world.   It is cited by the fossil fuel industry as an example of its transparency and good stewardship. It covers over a decade of on-shore fracking operations in most of the US states where fracking is active.  This period includes at least part of the fracking boom that made the US a dominant oil and gas producer.  FracFocus includes millions of chemical records in over 175,000 disclosures.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Safety Data Sheets\n",

These documents, summarized [here by OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3514.pdf) are primarily developed to inform workers who must work with these materials and to aid emergency response teams that might have to deal with spills or injuries. They are typically 3-15 pages and are usually found as PDF files. ([Click here for a quick example](https://ohiodnr.gov/static/documents/oil-gas/msds/Plexsurf+215E_Chemplex_SDS.pdf).

At most, these three ingredients comprise 46% of the mass in the product, and as little as 32%.  **What is in that other 54-68% of the product?**  Often, only the manufacturer knows. Even operating companies, while they are responsible for the completeness of the disclosure, may never know the ingredients of the products they use.

The SDS is not designed to be an exhaustive ingredient list unless all components are considered \"hazardous.\"  Perhaps all of those non-identified ingredients are inert, perhaps just water.  But there are reasons to be suspicious of what is **not** on the list.  First, what may be considered non-harzardous in an occupational setting (the main purpose of an SDS) may be problematic from an environmental perspective.  Second, what is considered hazardous can change over time.  For example, the status of PFAS chemicals [have recently changed dramatically in the US](https://www.epa.gov/pfas). Although the EPA has recently disallowed the use of PFAS chemicals in pesticides, it has become clear that not only were they used in pesticides **as inert ingredients** (and therefore, not on the SDS of the products), they were used at [incredibly high concentrations](https://peer.org/substantial-pfas-contamination-found-in-pesticides/). By not listing all ingredients, we lose the ability to interpret impacts of past fracking events.\n",

Considering that PFAS surfactants have been mentioned in multiple places (see [Horwitt & Gottlieb, 2022](https://psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fracking-with-forever-chemicals-in-colorado.pdf)) as highly effective in fracking, and yet they appear rarely in FracFocus, it is reasonable to be suspicious that they may be used either as inert ingredients or hidden as proprietary ingredients."

This water can include \"flow-back\" materials from the original fracking slug.  Some research estimates that 30-70% of the fracking chemicals injected into a well returns to the surface in the produced water in the months following the injection.  While this produced water has been used extensively in \"enhanced oil recovery,\" much of it is disposed in waste injection wells.  In recent years [there has been a push](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/19/texas-permian-basin-fracking-oil-wastewater-recycling/) to use it as part of the fracking carrier material in newer wells. \n",

    "The actual composition of produced water is usually hard to quantify.  Analysis of produced water is expensive and usually only tests for common markers such as mineral elements and known toxic materials (like BTEX).  Targeted analysis for specific molecules such as PFAS chemicals is rarely performed and, because it is targeted, can overlook materials that are important but not on the analyte list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, when analysis of produced water is performed, it is very common to find a toxic cocktail, usually a combination of \"natural\" materials, such as hydrocarbons, radionuclides, and heavy metals as well as flow-back materials from previous fracks and the chemicals formed under the high pressure and temperature of the fracking pressure.

    "#### The problem of UVCB for the public \n",
    "How can non-experts come to understand the risks of fracking chemicals?  We may look to **lists of problem chemicals** that have been assembled by experts after reviewing extensive detailed research.  Appropriate lists include the Clean Water Act lists, the Safe Drinking Water Act list, lists of known and suspect endocrine disrupters, and lists of carcinogens.  The problem for FracFocus users is that these lists depend on very well-defined chemical identification.  When a research paper is published that finds the toxicity of, say, naphthalene, researchers are reticent to apply those results to any other material, even if it is closely related, simply because toxicity can be highly dependent on specific molecular characteristics.   The consequence is that the UVCBs rarely show up on these lists of concern - even when they are very likely to contain those same toxic substances."
