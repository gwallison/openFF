# Getting Open-FF data

> **Important: Open-FF data is based on FracFocus data. FracFocus has outlined their “Terms of Use” on [their download page](https://fracfocus.org/data-download). Those requirements are relatively generous, but users of Open-FF data should be familiar with them.**

A full data set is available as a simple download [from here](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-common/repos/current_repo/full_df.parquet). The file is in ‘parquet’ format and is over 500Mbytes. If you have the ability to use parquet files, we recommend this version.  The same data in CSV formatted file is about ten times larger and requires more initial processing.

Otherwise, you may use the ["Data_set_customizer"]() notebook in the `notebook` directory of this repository.  With this notebook you can translate the data into CSV or Excel files and/or filter the data so the resulting file is a more managable size (for spreadsheet use, for example).  This notebook can be executed for free on Google's Colaboratory platform.

If you are not sure you need direct access to the data, you might consider using the [Data Browser](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Catalog.html) to try to answer your questions first.
