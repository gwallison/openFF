For each chemical that the EPA has published summaries, Open-FF generates a single image that indicates level of hazard for EPA's twenty categories.  See the table below or click on the specific chemical's report (its CAS number) for a different display of these results. For many chemicals reported by the EPA on that site, some of those hazard categories cannot be evaluated because the data are limited.  See EPA's disclaimer for these data below or at their site. Note that you can also see more details at the ChemInformatics site for the information used to generate these hazard summaries.\n",
