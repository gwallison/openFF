# Generating the Browser

Open-FF's Data Browser is designed to give quick access to the FracFocus data from several perspectives without downloading any data or executing any code.  

It is a large static website that is compiled roughly every month to incorporate the newest data.  The pages in the Browser are generated using a set of jupyter notebooks that model each type of webpage and the overall construction is handled by a set of python scripts.  The Browser is served from a Google Storage bucket.
