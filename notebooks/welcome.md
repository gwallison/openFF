## Welcome to the Open-FF Notebook Tools
This file is one of the tools developed to interact with Open-FF data. While it is a "coding notebook," it requires NO programming skills.  Prompts will guide you throughout the notebook indicating what you need to do in each section.

These noteboks are designed to accomplish well-defined tasks.  More general exploration is probably easier with the [Data Browser](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Catalog.html). On the other hand, more custom analysis will probably require downloading data sets targeted to your task.  (If you need assistance with the latter, feel free to contact us.)

This notebooks is designed to be used in the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/) service, a free platform that lets users run notebooks without needing to setup complicated "environments."  We will assume you are using this notebook on Colab and instructions are provided below.
