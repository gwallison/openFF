# Browser overview

The Open-FF [Data Browser](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Catalog.html) aims to provide a quick but comprehensive way for users to interact with the Open-FF data.  

## using the browser's tables interactively
Many tables in the browser are interactive. You can:
- re-sort the table by clicking on a column heading
- click there again to reverse the table order (from ascending to descending)
- sort by more than one column (clicking them in succesion) to facilitate finer sorting
- filter the records that are displayed by using the search box (for example, type in a company name to only show those records)
- control the number of records shown per page

# Chemical Index
The Browser's [Chemical Index](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Chemicals.html) provides a quick summary of the 1,300+ chemical materials that have been reported in FracFocus.  In addition, clicking on the CAS number for a given material takes the user to a page with detailed analysis of that chemical.  

# State and County Index
The Browser's [State Index](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_States_and_Counties.html) helps the user to view the FracFocus data from state-wide and county-level perspectives.  Here we find lists of the primary companies operating in these areas, the aggregate water use, trade secret frequency, and number of wells with school districts.  At the county level, maps and tables of individual fracking disclosures are presented.

# Operator Index
The Browser's [Operator Index](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Operator_Index.html) provides a company-ased perspective of the FracFocus data.  On individual company pages (numbering over 1,500), users will find maps of fracking locations, graphs of fracking activity hy years and state,  company-wide water use, the frequency of the company's use of chemicals of concern,  the suppliers/service companies used by these operators, and the frequency of trade secret designations. 

# FracFocus summaries
Also in the Browser is [a page dedicated to big picture summaries](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Scope_and_Aggregate_Stats.html) of data across FracFocus.  Here the user will find general statistics such as number of disclosures by year, summary of water use, summary of the biggest companies, and quick links to summary data.

# Other resources
## Data Dictionary
The Open-FF [Data Dictionary](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Data_Dictionary.html) provides 
- a description of both the original FracFocus fields (unchanged) and the generated Open-FF fields.
- a summary of the data patterns used to detect water carrier records and to flag disclosures that are unsuitable for mass calculations.

## Chemical Synonyms
For most CAS Numbers, there is more than on names that are acceptable. The [Chemical Synonym](https://storage.googleapis.com/open-ff-browser/Open-FF_Synonyms.html) table helps the user find the range of names for a chemical or, alternatively, find a CAS number for a known name.  The chemicals coverd in this include all in the FracFocus data set and a large set of related chemicals used in the industy.  There are over 170,000 entries.
