# Calculating Mass


### Chemical quantity
FracFocus provides a limited perspective of chemical quantity. For example, when FracFocus presents a chemical’s quantity, it reports the percentage (by weight) of the chemical compared to the overall fracking fluid. So, for the chemical “water,” FracFocus presents something like 85%.  For “sand,” it will probably be something like 14%. The fracking “additives” together are typically less than 1%. The percentages of individual additives are often tiny.  Viewing chemical quantity from only this perspective does indeed make the chemical’s contribution seem insignificant.   

However, another way to view chemical quantity is by mass; that is, the absolute weight of the chemical material used. Open-FF uses the FracFocus data to calculate that weight. For example, a typical fracking job in 2022 used 16 million gallons of water. That’s about 130 million pounds of water (1 gallon of water weighs about 8.3 pounds). If we use that typical percentage 85% for water, that means the total fracking fluid weighs about 156 million pounds. One more calculation: a typical percentage of hydrochloric acid is 0.06% of the whole fracking fluid and that translates into over 90,000 pounds of acid, which is hardly insignificant. There are many fracking jobs where hydrochloric acid use is much greater. As of Sept. 2023, there are more than 300 fracking jobs in the data set reporting over 1,000,000 pounds of the acid. While a user could calculate those weights directly from the data provided in FracFocus, Open-FF calculates weights for all FracFocus records (where data are sufficient) and users have easy access to those values.
