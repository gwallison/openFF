# Resolving Chemical Identity

Chemicals in FracFocus are disclosed with two identifiers: a name and a CAS Registry Number® (the Chemical Abstract Service assigns authoritative identifiers for materials).  Unfortunately, there are often errors in one or both of these identifiers and they can even be conflicting.  Where possible, Open-FF clarifies the identities; when not possible, it flags problem records. There are currently over 1,300 materials identified.  



Most of those chemicals will be unfamiliar to users and FracFocus has nothing to say about a chemical’s hazards. To help users, Open-FF identifies when a material is a chemical of concern (for example, is on the Clean Water Act list) and includes summaries of toxicity (such as EPA’s ChemInformatics) when available. But the unfortunate reality is that our understanding of the health and environmental impacts of fracking chemicals trails far behind the industry’s introduction of new untested materials. Open-FF is working to develop new ways of helping the public find up-to-date research and perspectives on the potential hazards of fracking chemicals.
