# The Open-FF Data Repository

Upon generation, the Open-FF data repository contains:
- The full data set, in a single file of parquet format (as of late 2023, this file is over 500 Mbytes)
- the full data set, as a set of tables (in parquet format) that can be used to construct a relational database, etc
- the zip file downloaded from FracFocus which provided the raw FracFocus data
- the curation files used to generate the various Open-FF fields (most are in parquet format)
- the information from CompTox, ChemInformatics and SciFinder that is used in identifying and characterizing the chemicals
- a list of all the files in the data repository
- an HTML record of the generation processes.
