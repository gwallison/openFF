### Creating a new Open-FF data set
Currently this is performed about monthly under [FracTracker](https://www.fractracker.org/)'s sponsorship.  While most users don't need to create a data set from scratch, understanding **how** the data are generated is often helpful to getting the most from the data.

### The Data Browser
Like the Open-FF data set, the  Data Browser is also updated regularly and users will likely have no need to generate them independently.  Nevertheless, its features and construction are also documented below. The repository for this code is [openFF-catalog](https://github.com/gwallison/openFF-catalog).

### Interactive Notebooks 
These notebooks are code Jupyter notebooks, but are designed to be used by people with no coding experience.  There are used to do targeted, well defined tasks that need user input.
