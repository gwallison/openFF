    "\n",
    "The primary source of data for the Open-FF project is [FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/), \"The national hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosure registry.\"  These data cover most US states where fracking is active; many states require operators to use FracFocus to disclose chemical information.  FracFocus began in 2011 and continues to release diclosures regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-FF uses the [bulk download](https://www.fracfocus.org/index.php?p=data-download) for the primary data set.  This set of over 6 million chemical records in over 200,000 disclosures is NOT a database. It contains several formats used by hundreds of different companies, often with poor attention to data completeness, quality, and standardization.  Summarizing patterns across the raw collection is very difficult.  Open-FF aims to transform this raw collection to produce data sets that improve standardization and completeness to facilitate big picture analysis of the industry's chemical use and disclosure practices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, Open-FF maintains supplementary data sets that are available to interested researchers. For example, the bulk download does not include chemical records released through May 2013, even though the data are [available as PDFs](http://fracfocusdata.org/DisclosureSearch/Search.aspx).  These supplementary resources provide access to the data in the PDFs. Additionally, connections to external lists, such as chemicals of concern, are provided in the data sets.\n"

CodeOcean also certifies that the code is reproducible.  More recently, the project is published at GitHub ([openFF](https://github.com/gwallison/openFF) and [openFF-catalog](https://github.com/gwallison/openFF-catalog)) and includes documentation.\n",

    "    - The chemical index provides a quick method to scan and search through the list of over 1300 chemicals used in FracFocus. This index lets users subset the material based of lists of chemicals of concern and other factors.  For each item on this table, the user can view summary analysis of the chemical.  In addition, from this table, a user can download a slice of the data set of just the records for this chemical.\n",
    "    - The synonym index helps users identify a CAS number if they know a particular chemical name. The results in this table also point to summary analysis of each chemical.\n",
    "    - The operator index sumarizes where and when a company is active, their water use through time as well as summaries of chemicals of concern and trade secret designations.\n",
