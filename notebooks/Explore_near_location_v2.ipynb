    "## Summarizing fracking chemicals used near a selected location \n",
    "---\n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook - a way to organize Python computer programming code. Hosting the notebook on Google Colab allows you to access and visualize data without actually needing to do any coding! Some code is left visible for individuals with a knowledge of Python or for those wondering how this site was put together. This allows for a more interactive user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you explore the chemicals that have been disclosed by the oil and gas industry to the FracFocus registry. FracFocus is an industry-created repository that references over 200,000 fracking events since 2011.  However, the FracFocus data presents many obstacles. Open-FF is an independent, open-source project to make the FracFocus data more robust and searchable and to provide some perspective about the chemicals reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use this notebook:\n",
    "After you load some necessary code and data (Step 1, which can take a minute or more), you will indicate what location you want to explore (which state in Step 2, and the lat/lon in step 3). In Step 4 you will select the size of the area around your focal location to search for fracked wells. In Step 5, you will generate the summarized chemical list for all the wells in that area. And finally in Step 6 you can save a record of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying your own search, you can run the entire notebook with just the default values by just stepping through each cell to the end to see how it works.  To run a code cell (they have an empty bracket `[ ]` in the upper left corner), hover your mouse over that bracket.  It should display a \"play\" icon.  Clicking that icon will execute the code in that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform more than one search, just start again at Step 2.  We only need to perform Step 1 once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into problems that you cannot remedy, please let me know! I'll try to get back to you as quick as possible.  (gary.allison@gmail.com)"
